Unit of Analysis: Counties in USA (2020-2022) 

Dependent Variable (DV): DV: Charging Staton data

Independent Variable (IV): EV population data, Per capita Income data, Population Estimate data, Unemployment data

RQ: How do county’s selected socio-economic variables - EV population, per capita income, population estimates, and unemployment rates – from 2020 to 2022 influence the distribution and availability of charging stations in various counties?

Hypothesis: Higher EV population, increased per capita income, larger population estimates and lower unemployment rate are positively associated with a greater distribution and availability of charging stations, across various counties from 2020 to 2022.
