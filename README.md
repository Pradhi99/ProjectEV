Unit of Analysis: Counties in USA (Year) 

Dependent Variable (DV): EV infrastructure

Independent Variable (IV): Socio-economic characteristics of the counties where EV owners reside

Research question: How does the EV infrastructure correlates with socio-economic characteristics of the counties where EV owners reside?
Note that socio-economic characteristics are a combination of social and economic factors such as age, financial, education, local policies etc. 

Hypothesis: There is no correlation between the EV infrastructure with the socio-economic characteristics of the counties.
